# java-compiler
## Overview
This project is a simple compiler project implemented in Java for my custom language. It includes the following core features:
### Primitive data types:
* integer: 32 bits, integer division
* double: 64 bits, can combine integer and double
* character: 16 bits
* strings: indefinite size, reassigned on resize (no concatenation with other variables)
* booleans: 1 bit, boolean logic 
### Variable scoping:
* global declarations
* local declarations
### Boolean logic
* and, or, conditional chaining
### Conditionals
* If, else, else-if
* While, for, do-while loop
### Methods
* Parameters, return types
* Recursion
Ultimately, it's just a fun project that I did to simulate a compiler. I used a fake "RAM" object with an array of 80000 to represent the raw memory acesses. See sample code for syntax (copycode, loops-functions-conditionals, variables).
